        <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
        <p>I am exciting about to create smalls words from my imaginations and in some cases give them life
	and like that feeling that something works and can be improved and adapted for diferents porpouses.</p>
<p>
I learnt many things but overall I really apreciate to be taught how to use lambda functions in javascript because I have seen in other languages and is very useful.
